# Difficulty: Easy

# Sometimes you wonder. How many days I have left until.....Whatever date you are curious about. Maybe a holiday.
# Maybe a vacation. Maybe a special event like a birthday.
# So today let us do some calendar math. Given a date that is in the future how many days until that date from the
# current date?
# Input:
# The date you want to know about in 3 integers. I leave it to you to decide if you want to do yyyy mm dd or
# mm dd yyyy or whatever. For my examples I will be using yyyy mm dd. Your solution should have 1 comment saying what
# format you are using for people reading your code. (Note you will need to convert your inputs to your format from
# mine if not using yyyy mm dd)

# Output:
# The number of days until that date from today's date (the time you run the program)
# Example Input: 2015 2 14
# Example Output: 5 days from 2015 2 9 to 2015 2 14

# Challenge Inputs:
# 2015 7 4
# 2015 10 31
# 2015 12 24
# 2016 1 1
# 2016 2 9
# 2020 1 1
# 2020 2 9
# 2020 3 1
# 3015 2 9
